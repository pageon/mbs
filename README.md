# mental-bucket-app

This app helps you to visualise your thoughts and emotions in a simple way through a bucket.
You can give every item a score from 1 to 4, with 4 being the most mentally taxing.

An overflow bucket is never a good sign, it means you have too much on your mind.

You can also store buckets and load them later, so you can keep track of your mental state over time.
